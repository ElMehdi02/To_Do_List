# To_Do_List


# ToDolist
## Context
In this project, I used JavaScript and CSS to create a functional To-Do List.

## Commands
- Variables containing various DOM elements needed to finalize the application.

- A `start` function for the alert and popup that will be displayed (time control).

- A `create` function for the dynamic creation of the POPUP.

- An anonymous `todo` function for adding tasks to the list.

- A `onetime` function to control the number of clicks.

- `click event listner` for adding tasks to the to-do list.

- A `retrieve` function to remove a task from the list.

- A `keyup event listner` to manage input and keyword search.
